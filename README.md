# opencode-plugin-lane

[Lane](https://github.com/lukeed/lane) copy-on-write worktrees as an **OpenCode V2 worktree strategy**.

Registers strategy `lane` through `ctx.worktree.transform`. OpenCode automatically selects the last registered strategy; unloading the plugin restores the previous strategy.

## Setup

1. Install [Lane](https://lane.lukeed.com/#installation) and Git on the machine running the OpenCode server. Tested with Lane **0.1.0** and `@opencode/plugin` **0.0.0-beta-19296**.
2. Install the plugin directly from GitHub over HTTPS:

```sh
opencode2 plugin add git+https://github.com/anomalyco/opencode-plugin-lane.git
```

OpenCode downloads the plugin and its dependencies and adds it to your global `opencode.jsonc`. No local clone, manual `bun install`, or npm publication is needed.

**Note:** Lane manages its own worktree directories under `<primary-checkout>/.lane/trees/` and ignores OpenCode's `worktree.directory` setting.

Lane creates `.lane/trees` and its Git exclusion on first creation. For Lane's memory workflow, run `lane init` yourself in the repository; that command also edits `AGENTS.md` and configures memory files.

## Options

To configure the plugin manually or pass options, use the Git HTTPS URL as the package target:

```jsonc
{
  "$schema": "https://opencode.ai/config.json",
  "plugins": [
    {
      "package": "git+https://github.com/anomalyco/opencode-plugin-lane.git",
      "options": {
        "executable": "/home/me/.local/bin/lane",
        "dirty": false,
      },
    },
  ],
}
```

| Option | Default | Behavior |
| --- | --- | --- |
| `executable` | `lane` | Command on the server's PATH, or an absolute binary path. |
| `dirty` | `false` | Pass `--dirty` to carry primary-checkout edits and untracked files. |

Git targets also accept a branch, tag, or full commit hash after `#`, such as `git+https://github.com/anomalyco/opencode-plugin-lane.git#main`.

## Behavior

- **Create:** takes the last component of OpenCode's suggested destination as the lane name and calls `lane new` under the primary checkout's `.lane/trees/`. Existing paths and branch names get a numeric suffix, with up to 10 candidates. An explicit OpenCode `branch` is passed as Lane's starting `--base` ref; otherwise the primary checkout's current HEAD is used. The actual created directory is returned to OpenCode.
- **List:** filters `lane ls --json` to native `.lane/trees` worktrees with Lane's per-worktree identity stamp and matching branch name. Ordinary Git worktrees are not claimed. The primary checkout is reported as a root.
- **Remove:** calls `lane rm` from the primary checkout. Lane's refusal to discard edits, pending notes, or unmerged commits becomes OpenCode's `forceRequired` error. Confirmed force passes `--force`. Lane removes the branch as well as the directory.
- **Cancellation:** subprocesses receive the operation's abort signal. Errors are surfaced to OpenCode; it does not retry creation using Git.

Lane 0.1.0 copies caches from the **primary checkout**, so the plugin rejects creation from linked checkouts. From a session in a linked checkout, supply `from: "/absolute/primary-checkout"` to the OpenCode worktree API. Listing and removal work from linked checkouts. Bare repositories and separate Git directories are unsupported by Lane's layout discovery.

Reflink-capable APFS, btrfs, or XFS filesystems get warm ignored caches; Lane skips those caches when reflinks are unavailable. `dirty` follows Lane's own materialization behavior. Startup commands and inventory bookkeeping remain OpenCode's responsibility.

## Development

```sh
bun install
bun run typecheck
LANE_BIN=/absolute/path/to/lane bun test
```

Integration tests use disposable Git repositories and the real Lane CLI, covering lifecycle, ownership, source/ref handling, dirty carry-over, force confirmation, path validation, and cancellation. Without `LANE_BIN` or `lane` on PATH, CLI integration tests are skipped.
